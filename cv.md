**Hello! My name is Valeria, but for friends just Valeron**
![This is me](https://psv4.userapi.com/c237331/u209334549/docs/d49/39dd82abc6b4/git-cv-avatar.png?extra=aMK6SHqL8dngi1dZVO1hS8TROYP_zbI2mC3fDzlIcQVjfuJoXF_vzy6VdGJjcEc7phL7Lw1tN-7qCnhZr9rVXKcIh-Bb-GKS5EvN0iOL-Gvrke_pcE_PaMxhOvODS00mA0xkNzEqRax2diBgUhjYqMkXMA)

*A young woman who never thought she'd want to get into programming, but here I am*

From my school days, I decided that my vocation was to benefit people, which is why I wanted to become a pathologist.
But at the last moment, the adult people who surrounded me decided that this was not a girl’s occupation, so it’s better not to go to study as a pharmacist, which I did.

Studying at the university was not as difficult as it was fun and full of pleasant acquaintances.


In 2018, I became a graduate. After receiving a certificate of completion of the internship, I got a second job, which, in terms of functional duties, was radically different from the main one. I have been doing this for over four years now.

My desire to learn JavaScript is not a spontaneous decision. After three years of intensive work in my specialty, I did not even hear gratitude for my excellent work, not to mention the constant reminder that "you should be grateful that you even have a job." It's unpleasant, isn't it?

I understood very well that in order to find a good job, you need to study, and this is not so easy, especially when there is no practice.
Therefore, I consulted with various acquaintances and friends who work in the field of IT, these were testers, python developers and also Java Script developers.
I weighed all the pros and cons, studied the essence of the work of these specialists and decided for myself that this course would be more interesting for me. Lightness is out of the question, because only an idiot will decide that everything is easy in IT.
